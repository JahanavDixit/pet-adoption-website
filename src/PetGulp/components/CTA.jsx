        <h2>Why to Adopt ?</h2>
        <p>
        Every stray animal has a story, and by choosing to adopt, you are changing their sad story to a happier one. Adoption is not just about providing a roof and meals; it's about giving a second chance at life to a loyal companion. When you adopt, you're not only gaining a best friend â€“ you're also making room for another rescue, thereby contributing to a much bigger picture of love, compassion, and change.
